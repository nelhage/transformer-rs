# transformer-rs
A sketch of a Transformer in Rust for pedagogical purposes.

This code is the companion piece for [the accompanying blog post](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/transformers-for-software-engineers/).

This repository contains an implementation of most of a decoder-only Transformer language model, implemented in Rust. The code is not runnable or designed to be run, but exists as a tool for explaining how these models work, and some of the perspectives employed or developed by the Interpretability team at [Anthropic](http://anthropic.com/) in our work on these models.
